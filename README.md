# Travel/Tour Booking Site 

Natours is a framework for a tour booking/travel site bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and designed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). I initially coded this with HTML/CSS(Sass) while completing his [Advanced CSS/Sass course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). I converted it to a React application and created reusable components for the navigation, cards, buttons, grid columns, headings, stories, and photo composition.
